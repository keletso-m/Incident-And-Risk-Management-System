#  TeamOps: Incident & Risk Management System

> A full-stack enterprise-grade platform for managing incidents, risk (ERM) tickets, and suspicious activity across engineering teams.  
> Built to simulate real-world DevOps, SecOps, and ITSM workflows — with a focus on reliability, accountability, and security.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**TeamOps** helps teams **detect, report, and resolve incidents**, while tracking associated **enterprise risk and mitigation plans**.  
It combines the best ideas from **PagerDuty**, **Jira Service Management**, and **internal DevSecOps dashboards** into one cohesive system.

### Core Features
-  **User & Role Management**
  - Admin, Engineer, Security Analyst, and Auditor roles
  - JWT-based authentication & role-based access control (RBAC)

-  **Project & Incident Tracking**
  - Create and manage incidents per project
  - Assign responders, track status, and post-incident actions

-  **ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) Tickets**
  - Log and assess risks (likelihood × impact)
  - Attach risks to related incidents for visibility

-  **Suspicious Activity Detection**
  - Logs API access, failed logins, and anomalies
  - Auto-triggers incidents when patterns exceed thresholds

- **Audit Logging & Reporting**
  - Full audit trail of user actions and system events
  - Exportable post-incident reports (JSON/CSV/PDF)

-  **Firewall & Rule Engine**
  - Simple rule-based system to block suspicious IPs or endpoints

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- React (Vite or Next.js)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS + ShadCN UI
- React Query (for data fetching)
- Zustand / Redux Toolkit (for state)
- Chart.js or Recharts (for analytics dashboard)

### **Backend**
- Node.js + **NestJS**
- TypeScript
- Prisma ORM
